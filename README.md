# Notice
I have note seen the midterm questions, and these problems were not meant to fill you in on the specific problems you would be solving. Rather, they were solely intended to reinforce your programming skills and Python syntax.

If you can grasp these solutions, then you are doing relatively well when it comes to programming. However, this class is not just that; it is Programming AND Problem Solving. You need to be able to read and perceive your instructions to determine what program you should write.

Having been said, best of luck and I hope that if you're reading this, the Practice Exam was of some benefit to you.
